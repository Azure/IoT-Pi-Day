# Lab 2.3 - Create a Function App and Event Hub Trigger Function
We need to document the scenario here

## Prerequisites
1. The Event Hub Namespace must already be created, see [Lab 0 - Resource Configuration, section Create an Event Hub namespace](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%200%20-%20Resource%20Configuration#create-an-event-hub-namespace)
2. The Event Hub must already be creaated, see [Lab 0 - Resource Configuration, section Create an Event Hub](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%200%20-%20Resource%20Configuration#create-an-event-hub-namespace)
3. The CosmosDB Account must already be created, see [Lab 0 - Resource Configuration, section Create a CosmosDB Account](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%200%20-%20Resource%20Configuration#create-a-cosmosdb-account)
4. The Laptop is setup correctly, see [Setting up the Laptop](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Setting%20up%20the%20Laptop).

## Create a function app from the Azure portal

Use the following steps to create an Azure Function:    
1. In a new browser window, sign in to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the Azure portal click **+Create a resource** at the top left of the screen.

1. In a new browser window, sign in to the [Azure Portal][Azure-Portal].

2. Click **+ Create a resource**.
3. Click **Compute**.
3. Select **Function App** on the right panel.

4. Fill in the fields:
   - **App name**, enter **<**LastName**>-pi-day-functionapp**
   - **Subscription**  Select your subscription.
   - **Resource Group**  Select your resource Group.
   - **OS** We are using Windows for these labs.
   - **Hosting Plan**  Ensure **Consumption plan** is selected.
        > Hosting plan that defines how resources are allocated to your function app. In the default Consumption Plan, resources are added dynamically as required by your functions. In this serverless hosting, you only pay for the time your functions run. When you run in an App Service plan, you must manage the scaling of your function app.
   * **Location**  Select the same location as before.
   * **Runtime Stack** Select **.NET**
   * **Storage** Create a storage account used by your function app, consider **functionappstorage**.
        > Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.
   * **Application Insights**, select On.
   * **Application Insights Location**, select same location as before.
5. Select **Create** to provision and deploy the function app.

## Create the EventHubTrigger Function Project

Use the Event Hubs trigger to respond to an event sent to an event hub event stream. You must have read access to the event hub to set up the trigger. When an Event Hubs trigger function is triggered, the message that is passed into the function a string type.

We will be using Visual Studio Code and the Azure Functions Extension.
1. Navigate to the Workspace created in [Setting up the Laptop](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Setting%20up%20the%20Laptop).
2. Open up a **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** as an **Administrator**.
    - Type **```CD C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 2 - Working with Hubway Data\Workspace\HubwayFunctions```**
3.  Enter **```code .```** and press return.
    > This brings up an instance on Visual Studio Code with HubwayFunctions selected as the working folder.
3.  Press **Ctrl-Shift-P**.
4.  Enter Azure Functions and select **Create New Project** from the list.
