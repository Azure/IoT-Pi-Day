5. ?ðŸš¨? To update packages and resolve any dependancies, type the following at the terminal command prompt.
    - **```dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client --version 1.19.0```**

6. Edit the file **SimulatedDevice.cs** by clicking on the filename in the left panel.

7.  Copy the connection string from the IoT Hub you created previously.  
    - Go to the **Azure Portal**.
    - In the left side menu, click on **Resource Groups**.
    - Select the resource group created previously. i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
    - Click on the IoT Hub that you created.

    - Select the **IoT Devices** menu on the left.
    - Select **your device name** from the window
    - Copy the **connection string (primary key)**.
        
        > Example:  "HostName=smith-iothub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=RaspberryPIHostName;SharedAccessKey=WAvH5fGAZHKo6U3ccUBpiHa7r1wETD+9gja/Aim6HiR=";

   ![Image](/images/lab-0-imagex.png)

8. In Visual Studio Code, replace <**Your IoT Hub Connnection String**> in the file **simulated-device.cs** with your connection string from the IoT Hub. 

9. Press **Cntrl-S** to save the file.
   
## ?ðŸš¨? Test the Function

1. Make sure the Output window is displayed in the bottom panel of Visual studio Code.

    > Note: Press **Cntl-Shift-U** to view the output window. 

2. Press **F5** to run with debugging.

    > Note: If all went well, you should see each record in JSON format being sent up to the IoT Hub.

3.  Press **Cntrl-F5** to stop.

##  Compile the code
1.  From the already opened Command Prompt or PowerShell prompt.

2. Confirm you are sitting in the correct folder.

    > C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 2 - Working with Hubway Data\Solution\IotProject\simulated-device

3.  Run the following commands:
    - **```dotnet clean .```**
    - **```dotnet build .```**
    - **```dotnet publish . -r linux-arm```**

##  Deploy to Raspberry PI

1.  From the existing Command Prompt or PowerShell Prompt, cut-n-paste the below line and format it as follows: **scp.exe -r .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.2\linux-arm\publish\* <**username**>@<**device ip address**>:/home/<**pi1**>/SimulatedDevice**

    **```scp.exe -r .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.2\linux-arm\publish\* pi1@192.168.1.200:/home/pi1/SimulatedDevice```**

2. When prompted to continue to connect, type **yes**.
3. Type in **Password.1.!!** as the password.

4.  From the existing Command Prompt or PowerShell Prompt, cut-n-paste the below line and format it as follows: **scp.exe -r .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.2\linux-arm\publish\* <**username**>@<**device ip address**>:/home/<**pi1**>/SimulatedDevice/data/**

    **```scp.exe -r .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.2\linux-arm\publish\* pi1@192.168.1.200:/home/pi1/SimulatedDevice/data/```**

5. When prompted to continue to connect, type **yes**.
6. Type in **Password.1.!!** as the password.

## Run the code from the Raspberry PI

 1. Run **PuTTY** or **Windows 10 SSH** to Telnet into the Raspberry Pi Device using SSH.
 2. Enter the **IP address** of the Raspberry Pi Device.
 3. Click **Open** and Accept the message about keys.
    - Enter <**pi1**> as the logon name, and **Password.1.!!** as the password.
4.  Once you are logged in
5.  Type **```cd SimulatedDevice```**
6.  Type **```chmod 755 SimulatedDevice```**

7. Verify that permissions has been changed on the executable.
8. Type **```ls -al```**, the scroll up and locate **simulated-device**, it should be green.

    ![Image](/images/lab-1.1-imagex.png)

9.  To execute the code, type **```./simulated-device```**

    > Note: If all went well, you should see each record in JSON format being sent up to the IoT Hub.  There are **60,315 rows** of data being sent to IoT Hub.

## Verify data is being sent to Azure IoT Hub

1. Go to the **Azure Portal**.
2. In the left side menu, click on **Resource Groups**.
3. Select the resource group created previously. i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
4. Click on the IoT Hub that you created.

    ![Image](/images/lab-0-imagex.png)

6. Click on the **Overview** menu on the left.
7. Scroll to bottom of blade and select **Device to cloud messages**
8. On the **Metrics** page, change the timeframe to **Last 30 minutes** and time granularity to **1 minute**.

6. Verify you are seeing data being sent to your IoT Hub.

    > IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables you to ingest high volumes of telemetry from your IoT devices into the cloud for storage or processing. You are now sending information from the Raspberry Pi device to Azure IoT Hub. At this point, nothing interesting is happening in the cloud with that data you are sending to Azure. It is simply being persisted for a default amount of time (1-day) and then being dropped.

7. From the existing Telnet window, press **Cntl-C** to stop.
