# Lab 2.4 - Update Function App and Triggers
We need to document the scenario here

## Prerequisites
1. The Resource Configuation Lab is completed, see [Lab 1.0 - Resource Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%201%20-%20Getting%20started%20with%20the%20Sense%20HAT/Lab%201.0%20-%20Resource%20Configuration)
2. The Resource Configuation Lab is completed, see [Lab 2.0 - Resource Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%202%20-%20Working%20with%20Hubway%20Data/Lab%202.0%20-%20Resource%20Configuration)
3. Completion of Lab 2.1 through 2.3 must be done.

## Create a function app from the Azure portal

Use the following steps to create an Azure Function:    

1. In a new browser window, sign in to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the Azure portal click **+Create a resource** at the top left of the screen.

3. In the **Search the Marketplace** textbox, type **Function** and press **Enter**.

4. Select **Function App** from the list.

    ![Image](/images/lab-2.4-image2.png)

5. Click **Create** to create a IoT Hub.

6. Fill in the fields:

   - **App Name**, type in the name for your Function App. This name must be globally unique, type **<*lastname*>-piday-functionapp**.

    - **Subscription**, select the subscription to use for your Function App.

    - **Resource Group**, choose **Use existing** and select the one created already, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
   
    - **Location**, choose the same one you already selected.

    - **OS** We are using **Windows** for these labs.

    - **Hosting Plan**, Select **Consumption plan**.
        > Hosting plan that defines how resources are allocated to your function app. In the default Consumption Plan, resources are added dynamically as required by your functions. In this serverless hosting, you only pay for the time your functions run. When you run in an App Service plan, you must manage the scaling of your function app.
   
    - **Location**, choose the same one you already selected.

    - **Runtime Stack** Select **.NET**

    - **Storage**, select **Create new** storage account for your function app, type **<*lastname*>pidayfuncstorage**.

        > Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.
   
    - **Application Insights**, select **Enable**.
   
        - **Application Insights Location**, select same location as before.

        ![Image](/images/lab-2.4-image3.png) 

7. Select **Create** to provision and deploy the function app.

## Azure Credentials

This is only required if it's the first time you're logging into Azure from Visual Studio Code.

1. From Visual Studio Code, press **Cntl-Shift-P**
2. Enter **Azure** and select **Sign in to Azure Cloud**
3. Authenticate to Azure when the dialog box appears.

    > Note: Once you are signed in, close the web page and return to Visual Studio Code.

## Develop the HubwayFunctions code
### ?ðŸš¨? Create the EventHubTrigger Function Project

We use the Event Hubs trigger to respond to an event sent to an event hub event stream. You must have read access to the event hub to set up the trigger. When an Event Hubs trigger function is triggered, the message that is passed into the function is a string type. We will be using Visual Studio Code and the Azure Functions Extension.

1. Open up a Command Prompt or PowerShell as an Administrator.
2. Navigate to the Workspace created in [Setting up the Laptop](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Setting%20up%20the%20Laptop).
    - Simply Copy the following line and Paste at the command prompt:

        **```CD C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 2 - Working with Hubway Data\Solution\HubwayFunctions```**

3. Confirm you are sitting in the correct folder.

    > C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 2 - Working with Hubway Data\Solution\HubwayFunctions

4. Type **```code .```** (that's **code space dot**) to open **HubwayFunctions.csproj** with **Visual Studio Code**.

5. Click **Restore** for the message about unresolved dependencies.

6. Navigate to the resource group.

    - From the Azure Portal from the left menu, click on **Resource Groups**.
    - Select the resource group created previously, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
    - Click on the Event Hub namespace created earlier, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-eventhub**.

    ![Image](/images/lab-2.4-image4.png)

7. Update the **Event Hub** connection string.

    - Under **Settings**, click on **Shared access policies**.
    - Click **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.
    - Copy the **Connection string-primary key**.

        ![Image](/images/lab-2.4-image5.png)

    - From Visual Studio Code, open the file **local.settings.json** and **Paste** in the connection string between the quotes on the **Shared_Access_Key_EVENTHUB** line.

        ![Image](/images/lab-2.4-image6.png) 

8. Update the **AzureWebJobsStorage** connection string.

    - From the Azure Portal in the left menu, click on **Resource Groups**.
    - Select the resource group created previously. i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
    - Click on the Storage Account created earlier, i.e. **<*lastname*>pidaydatastorage**.

    ![Image](/images/lab-2.4-image7.png)

    - Under **Settings**, click on **Access Keys**.
    - Copy the **Connection String** under **key1**.

        ![Image](/images/lab-2.4-image8.png)  

    - From Visual Studio Code, open the file **local.settings.json** and **Paste** in the connection string between the quotes on the **AzureWebJobsStorage** line.

## Test the Function
Let's test the Event Hub trigger to ensure it's firing and ready to process data.

1. From **Visual Studio Code**, double-click on file **HubwayEventHubTrigger.cs** to open in the editor
2. To execute the code, press **F5**.
3. Telnet into the Raspberry Pi using SSH and login.
4. Once you are logged in, type **cd SimulatedDevice**.
5. Exectute the code, type **./simulated-device**.

    > Refer to Lab 2.1.1 - Send Hubway data to Iot Hub, section [Run the code from the Raspberry PI](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%202%20-%20Working%20with%20Hubway%20Data/Lab%202.1%20-%20IoT%20Hub/Lab%202.1.1%20-%20Send%20Hubway%20Data%20to%20Iot%20Hub#run-the-code-from-the-raspberry-pi)


6. If all went well, you should see each record in JSON format being sent up to the IoT Hub from Visual Studio Code.
