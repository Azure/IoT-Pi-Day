# Lab 2.4 - Create a Function App and Event Hub Trigger Function
We need to document the scenario here

## Prerequisites
1. The Resource Configuation Lab is completed, see [Lab 1.0 - Resource Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%201%20-%20Getting%20started%20with%20the%20Sense%20HAT/Lab%201.0%20-%20Resource%20Configuration)
2. The Resource Configuation Lab is completed, see [Lab 2.0 - Resource Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%202%20-%20Working%20with%20Hubway%20Data/Lab%202.0%20-%20Resource%20Configuration)
3. Completion of Lab 2.1 through 2.3 must be done.

## Create a function app from the Azure portal

Use the following steps to create an Azure Function:    

1. In a new browser window, sign in to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the Azure portal click **+Create a resource** at the top left of the screen.

3. In the **Search the Marketplace** textbox, type **Function** and press **Enter**.

4. Select **Function App** from the list.
5. Click **Create** to create a IoT Hub.

    ![Image](/images/lab-0-imagex.png)

6. Fill in the fields:

   - **App Name**, type in the name for your Function App. This name must be globally unique, type **<*lastname*>-piday-functionapp**.

    - **Subscription**, select the subscription to use for your Function App.

    - **Resource Group**, choose **Use existing** and select the one created already, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
   
    - **Location**, choose the same one you already selected.

    - **OS** We are using Windows for these labs.

    - **Hosting Plan**  Ensure **Consumption plan** is selected.
        > Hosting plan that defines how resources are allocated to your function app. In the default Consumption Plan, resources are added dynamically as required by your functions. In this serverless hosting, you only pay for the time your functions run. When you run in an App Service plan, you must manage the scaling of your function app.
   
    - **Location**, choose the same one you already selected.

    - **Runtime Stack** Select **.NET**

    - **Storage**, select **Create new** storage account for your function app, type **<*lastname*>pidayfuncstorage**.
        > Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.
   
    - **Application Insights**, select **Enable**.
   
    - **Application Insights Location**, select same location as before.

5. Select **Create** to provision and deploy the function app.

## Azure Credentials

This is only required if it's the first time you're logging into Azure from Visual Studio Code.

1. From Visual Studio Code, press **Cntl-Shift-P**
2. Enter **Azure** and select **Sign in to Azure Cloud**
3. Authenticate to Azure when the dialog box appears.

    > Note: Once you are signed in, close the web page and return to Visual Studio Code.

## ?ðŸš¨? Create the EventHubTrigger Function Project
## Develop the HubwayFunctions code

Use the Event Hubs trigger to respond to an event sent to an event hub event stream. You must have read access to the event hub to set up the trigger. When an Event Hubs trigger function is triggered, the message that is passed into the function is a string type.

We will be using Visual Studio Code and the Azure Functions Extension.

1. Open up a Command Prompt or PowerShell as an Administrator.
2. Navigate to the Workspace created in [Setting up the Laptop](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Setting%20up%20the%20Laptop).
    - Simply Copy the following line and Paste at the command prompt:

        **```CD C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 2 - Working with Hubway Data\Solution\HubwayFunctions```**

3. Confirm you are sitting in the correct folder.

    > C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 2 - Working with Hubway Data\Solution\HubwayFunctions

4. Type **```code .```** (that's **code space dot**) to open **HubwayFunctions.csproj** with **Visual Studio Code**.

5. Click **Restore** if there is a **There are unresolved dependencies** message.
