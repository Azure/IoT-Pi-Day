# Lab 1.1 - Reading SenseHat Data
In this lab, we are running a program on the Raspberry Pi device that will grab temperature, humidity and barometric pressure from the SenseHAT and send it on a regular basis to the Azure IOT Hub we setup in a previous lab.

## Prerequisites
1. The Laptop is setup correctly, see [Setting up the Laptop](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Setting%20up%20the%20Laptop).
2. The Resource Configuation Lab is completed, see [Lab 1.0 - Resource Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/IoT-Pi-Day/tree/master/Lab%201%20-%20Getting%20started%20with%20the%20Sense%20HAT/Lab%201.0%20-%20Resource%20Configuration).
3. Have the IP address of your Raspberry Pi device.  If you donâ€™t have it, ask a proctor for it.
    > Each device has been assisnged an IP Address that correlate to it's MAC Address.

## Estimated time to complete

    - Simply Copy the following line and Paste at the command prompt:

        **```CD C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 1 - Getting started with the Sense HAT\Solution\SenseHATDotNetCore```**

3. Confirm you are sitting in the correct folder.

    > C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 1 - Getting started with the Sense HAT\Solution\SenseHATDotNetCore

4. Type **```code .```** (that's **code space dot**) to open **SenseHATDotNetCore.csproj** with **Visual Studio Code**.

5. Click on **Terminal** in the top menu and select **New Terminal** to open a new terminal window below.
6. Press **Enter** to get the prompt.

7. Click **Restore** to resolve dependencies message and update packages.

## Azure Credentials

This is only required if it's the first time you're logging into Azure from Visual Studio Code.

1. From Visual Studio Code, press **Cntl-Shift-P**
2. Enter **Azure** and select **Sign in to Azure Cloud**
3. Authenticate to Azure when the dialog box appears.

    > Note: Once you are signed in, close the web page and return to Visual Studio Code.

## Develop SenseHATDotNetCore code

1. Select the resource group.

    - In a browser window, sign in to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
    - Click on **Resource Groups**.
    - Select the resource group created previously, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
    - Click on the IoT Hub created earlier, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-iothub**.

2. Copy the **IoT Hub** connection string.

    - Under **Explorers**, select the **IoT Devices** menu on the left
    - Select **your device name** from the window, i.e. **raspberrypi-det-000**.

        ![Image](/images/lab-1.1-image3.png) 

    - Copy the **Connection string (primary key)**.

        ![Image](/images/lab-1.1-image4.png)

3.  Replace the **IoT Hub Device Connnection String**.

    - From Visual Studio Code, edit the **Program.cs** by clicking on the filename in the left panel.

    - **Paste** in and replace your <**IoT Hub Device Connnection String**>.

4.  Update the Raspberry Pi device hostname.  

    - Replace <**Your Raspberry Pi Device Name**> in **Program.cs** with Raspberry Pi device hostname.
    - Type your assigned Raspberry Pi device hostname. i.e. **raspberrypi-det-000**.

3. Press **Cntrl-S** to save the file.

##  Compile the code
1. From the existing Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2. Confirm you are sitting in the correct folder.

    > C:\Workspace\IoT-Pi-Day-master\Lab 1 - Getting started with the Sense HAT\Solution\SenseHATDotNetCore

3.  Run the following commands and press **Enter** after each one:
    - **```dotnet clean .```**
    - **```dotnet build .```**
    - **```dotnet publish . -r linux-arm```**

##  Deploy to Raspberry Pi
1.  From the existing Command Prompt or PowerShell Prompt, cut-n-paste the below line and format it as follows: **scp.exe -r .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.2\linux-arm\publish\* <**username**>@<**device ip address**>:/home/<**pi1**>/SenseHATDotNetCore**

    **```scp.exe -r .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.2\linux-arm\publish\* pi1@192.168.1.203:/home/pi1/SenseHATDotNetCore```**

3. When prompted to continue to connect, type **yes**.
4. Type in **```Password.1.!!```** as the password.

## Run the code from the Raspberry Pi

 1. Run **PuTTY** or **Windows 10 SSH** to connect to the Raspberry Pi Device.
 2. Enter the **IP address** of the Raspberry Pi Device.
 3. Click **Open** and Accept the message about keys.
    - Enter <**pi1**> as the logon name, and **```Password.1.!!```** as the password.
4.  Once you are logged in
5.  Type **```cd SenseHATDotNetCore```**
6.  Type **```chmod 755 SenseHATDotNetCore```**

7. Verify that permissions has been changed on the executable.
8. Type **```ls -al```**, the scroll up and locate **SenseHATDotNetCore**, it should be green.

    ![Image](/images/lab-1.1-image8.png)

9.  To execute the code, type **```./SenseHATDotNetCore```**

    > Note: If all went well, you should see each record in JSON format being sent up to the IoT Hub.

## Verify data is being sent to Azure IoT Hub

1. Select the resource group.

    - From the Azure Portal from the left menu, click on **Resource Groups**.
    - Select the resource group created previously, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-rg**.
    - Click on the IoT Hub created earlier, i.e. **<*lastname*>-piday-iothub**.

        ![Image](/images/lab-1.1-image2.png) 

2. Verify you are seeing data being sent to your IoT Hub.

    > IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables you to ingest high volumes of telemetry from your IoT devices into the cloud for storage or processing. You are now sending information from the Raspberry Pi device to Azure IoT Hub. At this point, nothing interesting is happening in the cloud with that data you are sending to Azure. It is simply being persisted for a default amount of time (1-day) and then being dropped.

    - Click on the **Overview** menu on the left.
    - In the right panel, scroll to bottom of blade and click on **Device to cloud messages**.
    - On the **Metrics** page, change the timeframe to **Last 30 minutes** and time granularity to **1 minute**.

3. From the existing **PuTTY** or **Windows 10 SSH** telnet window, press **Ctrl-C** to stop sending data.
